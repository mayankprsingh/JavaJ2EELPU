J2EE-Project-LMSPanel
Web Application based on Spring Boot

It was a Web Application based on the concepts of Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB and HTML5. The objective was to create a Learning Management System which can perform basic CRUD operations along with listing the details.

I've used gradle for dependencies.

Platform used for this project was Eclipse Enterprise Edition.
